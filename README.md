## Aesthetics
The look and feel of everything

For the time being, I believe we should have a *static site* with minimal functionality, starting with the overall look using HTML/CSS to start the structure of each individual page.

Most team site have **3 pages at most**, I'm thinking of having a maximum of 4 plus a defaced page, similar to the one that Flat Net Society has.
